# Registration

In order to use the API, you'll have to become a registered user.  
To do this, send a POST request to:  
  `[root-url]/api/v1/users`,  
with the request body containing the following information in JSON format:

- username
- password
- name
- surname

Example request body:

```json
       {
          "username": "exampleUsername",
          "password": "examplePassword",
          "name":     "exampleName",
          "surname":  "exampleSurname"
       }
```

After that, you should get a "SUCCESS" response, which means you can now use the API.
