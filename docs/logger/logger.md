### This table below should guide you on which log4j2 level should be used in which case.

### We mainly have 3 components to work with Log4j

**Logger**: It is used to log the messages.  
**Appender**: It is used to publish the logging information to the destination like the file, database, console etc.  
**Layout**: It is used to format logging information in different styles.

### Create a Log Directory

Create directories for the log files.

Oracle recommends the directory/file permission should be (rw-,r---). Only the install owner and group should be allowed
to read these files due to the sensitive nature of the information that could be contained within them.

### Pre-requisites for Email Alerts

For email alerts to work, third-party libraries must be copied into the WEB-INF/lib folder.
The required files are _activation.jar_, which can be downloaded from

_mail.jar_, which can be downloaded from
