# OpenApi
**OpenApi** java library helps to automate the generation of API documentation using spring boot projects. springdoc-openapi works by examining an application at runtime to infer API semantics based on spring configurations, class structure and various annotations.
Automatically generates documentation in JSON/YAML and HTML format APIs. This documentation can be completed by comments using swagger-api annotations.
